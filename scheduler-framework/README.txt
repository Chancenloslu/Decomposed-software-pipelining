EXECUTION OF SCHEDULER FRAMEWORK

1. In IntelliJ
	1.1. Unzip SchedulerFramework.zip
	1.2. Open project by selecting the folder "scheduler-framework" in IntelliJ's opening dialog
	1.3. If the source files are not present in the project structure,
	     go to File -> Project Structure... -> Modules -> + -> Import Module,
	     select the folder "scheduler-framework/src" and finish the dialog to import the source files.
	1.4. Go to Run -> Run... -> Edit Configurations -> + -> Application, select file "scheduler.Main"
	1.5. Add <dotfile> <resource_constraints_file> to program arguments
         (e.g. graphs/testCyclic.dot resources/vlsi/fpga_4Mul)

2. In Eclipse
	2.1. Unzip SchedulerFramework.zip
	2.2. Import Eclipse project from root folder SchedulerFramework
	2.3. Open src/scheduler/Main.java
	2.4. Go to Run -> Run Configurations
	2.5. Select Arguments and add <dotfile> <resource_constraints_file> to program arguments
		 (e.g. graphs/testCyclic.dot resources/vlsi/fpga_4Mul)

3. With make
	3.1. Unzip SchedulerFramework.zip
	3.2. Change directory to <path>/scheduler-framework
	4.3. Call:
			make run args="<dotfile> <resource_constraints_file>"
		    (e.g. graphs/testCyclic.dot resources/vlsi/fpga_4Mul)

USAGE OF THE SCHEDULE VALIDATOR

The framework contains the class "Validator" that can be used to perform simple validations of schedules.
It reads DOT files containing schedules that adhere to the format generated by the "draw" function of the Schedule class.
It can be used stand-alone to validate schedules generated outside the framework, as long as the DOT file adheres to the format.
Format requirements are described in ScheduleReader.java.
As only argument, it takes the path to the schedule DOT file.
